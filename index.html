        <div class="bbox" style="height:550px">Hello everyone, my name is Randolph Forbes. I go by
          Randy though. I was born in the Philippines, but grew up around the
          US; California, Florida, South Carolina. I graduated high school in
          2005 and then went into the world's finest Navy. From there I became
          an Electronic Technician working with sonar, radar, communication, and
          electronics repair. From there I started taking electronic engineering
          courses to advance myself. During that timeframe I got a wife and a
          kid on the way, so I became a stay at home dad and worked on the
          weekends. Eventually moved back to South Carolina and became a
          Maintenance Technician with a focus on Kuka Robotics.<br>
